## Why WorkOrbit Exists

The freelance economy has three problems that blockchain is actually suited to solve:

- **Custody risk** — platforms hold client funds, creating a single point of failure and requiring trust in the intermediary.
- **Settlement lag** — traditional payment rails (wire, ACH, PayPal) settle in 1–5 days, so freelancers wait days after work is approved.
- **Cross-border cost** — international payments lose 3–8% to FX and remittance fees, disproportionately hurting freelancers in emerging markets.

WorkOrbit puts escrow logic on Soroban, Stellar's smart contract layer. Funds are held by code, not by WorkOrbit. Payments settle in ~5 seconds. And because the payment rail is Stellar, a freelancer in Lagos and a client in Berlin share the same asset contract — no FX intermediary required.

---

## Why Stellar Specifically

> This section explains why Stellar is not interchangeable with Ethereum, Solana, or any other chain for this use case.

### 1. Built for payments, not computation

Stellar was designed from the ground up to move value, not to run general-purpose computation. That gives it properties no EVM chain has by default:

| Property | Stellar | Ethereum L1 | Solana |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| Finality | ~5 s | ~13 min (PoS) | ~0.4 s |
| Tx fee | ~$0.00001 | $0.50–$50+ | ~$0.00025 |
| Native multi-asset | Yes (SEP-4) | No (ERC-20 required) | No (SPL required) |
| Anchor ecosystem | Yes (SEP-24/31) | No | No |

A freelance payment platform that charges users $5–$50 per release transaction is not a product. Stellar's fee model makes per-milestone payments — including small ones like a $20 milestone — economically rational.

### 2. Soroban for trustless escrow (not multisig)

The naive approach to blockchain escrow is Stellar multisig: require N-of-M signers to move funds. This is simpler but keeps the platform as a custodian — if WorkOrbit holds a signing key, WorkOrbit can theoretically take the money.

Soroban contracts make the **rules code, not trust**. The WorkOrbit escrow contract (`stellance/Contracts/src/lib.rs`) enforces:

- `fund()` — client locks tokens; the contract is the only custodian from this point
- `release_milestone(amount)` — client (or admin) releases exactly one milestone's amount; cannot overdraw; emits an on-chain event
- `release()` — full release of all remaining funds
- `refund()` — freelancer (or admin) returns funds; client cannot self-refund
- `dispute()` — either party freezes funds; blocks `release` and `refund` until resolved
- `resolve_dispute(decision, bps)` — admin-only arbitration with atomic split (e.g. 60% freelancer / 40% refund)

The split resolution is a concrete example of what Soroban enables that multisig doesn't: two transfers in a single transaction, enforced atomically by the VM, with no way for the platform to deviate. Ethereum could do this, but at 100× the cost.

### 3. Stellar anchors for real-world on/off-ramps

Stellar's [SEP-24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md) anchor ecosystem connects Stellar to local banking rails in 50+ countries. Anchors issue fiat-pegged tokens (USDC, NGN, PHP stablecoins) on Stellar and handle the local bank transfer for deposit and withdrawal.

For a freelance platform this matters directly:

- A client can deposit USD to fund a contract; the anchor converts it to USDC on Stellar.
- The WorkOrbit escrow contract holds USDC (same SEP-41 token interface as XLM).
- When the milestone is released, the freelancer can withdraw to their local bank via the same anchor or a local one.

This cross-border flow — client funds in USD → Stellar USDC → freelancer withdraws in PHP — is available today on Stellar. It doesn't exist natively on Ethereum L1 or Solana. An Ethereum-based escrow platform would need to integrate Stripe, Wise, or similar third-party payment processors for each corridor separately. Stellar handles this at the protocol level.

### 4. SEP-41 token interface: asset-agnostic escrow

The WorkOrbit escrow contract accepts any Stellar asset that implements the SEP-41 token interface. This is not aspirational — it's built into the contract type system:

```rust
pub fn fund(
    env: Env,
    contract_id: Symbol,
    client: Address,
    freelancer: Address,
    admin: Address,
    amount: i128,
    token: Address,   // ← any SEP-41 token: XLM, USDC, or any anchor-issued asset
) -> Result<(), EscrowError>
```

The same contract handles XLM and USDC without modification. Token support is a configuration choice at the UX layer, not a contract change.

### 5. Low fees enable milestone granularity that isn't economically viable elsewhere

Ethereum's gas model creates a floor cost for on-chain actions. At $1+ per transaction, splitting a $500 contract into 10 milestones costs $10 in gas — 2% overhead before the platform takes anything.

On Stellar, 10 milestone releases cost roughly $0.0001. This means WorkOrbit can support fine-grained milestone tracking (hourly work logs, small deliverables, weekly check-ins) without forcing clients and freelancers to batch payments to amortize gas costs. The payment granularity can match the work structure, not the fee structure.

### 6. On-chain events for verifiable payment history

Every state transition in the WorkOrbit escrow contract emits a Soroban event. Events are stored in Horizon and queryable without running a full node. This means:

- Any payment record in the WorkOrbit database has a corresponding immutable on-chain event.
- Freelancers can independently verify their payment history on [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert) without trusting WorkOrbit's database.
- Dispute evidence (when a dispute was raised, by whom) is tamper-proof.

This is a specific Stellar/Soroban capability: Ethereum events are similar, but querying them requires an archive node or a paid third-party indexer. Horizon is a free, publicly hosted indexer provided by the Stellar Development Foundation.

## Current Implementation Status

| Layer | What exists today | What's in active development |
|-------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Soroban contract** | `fund`, `release_milestone`, `release`, `refund`, `dispute`, `resolve_dispute`, `get_escrow` — fully implemented, 30 tests, WASM build ✅ | Testnet deployment, backend integration wiring |
| **Backend** | Auth (JWT + refresh token rotation), Users, Jobs CRUD, Contracts + Milestones (fund XDR, milestone approve/submit, dispute, resolve, cancel), Escrow service (Stellar SDK), Prisma schema ✅ | Payments module, Freighter-signed dispute flow |
| **Frontend** | Marketing landing page, live testnet demo (Friendbot + 1 XLM payment via Horizon), payments UI (mock data) | Marketplace UI, Freighter wallet integration, contract invocation |
| **CI** | Lint, test (backend 71 tests, Rust 30 tests), WASM build | — |

### What the demo proves today

Visit `/demo`: generate a Stellar keypair, fund it via Friendbot, and submit a real XLM transaction on the Stellar testnet. This demonstrates that the payment rail works end-to-end — Horizon connectivity, transaction building, signing, and submission.

### What the contract proves

The Soroban contract (`stellance/Contracts/src/lib.rs`) implements the full escrow state machine with 20+ tests covering: partial milestone release, double-release prevention, dispute freezing, admin-only dispute resolution, atomic splits, and unauthorized-caller rejection. It compiles to WASM and is ready to deploy to testnet.

---

## How It Works

1. **Connect** — Freelancers and clients connect a Stellar wallet (Freighter).
2. **Create contract** — Clients post jobs and agree terms with freelancers.
3. **Fund escrow** — Client calls `fund()` on the Soroban contract; tokens leave their wallet and enter the contract.
4. **Deliver milestones** — Freelancer submits work; client reviews.
5. **Release payment** — Client (or admin on dispute) calls `release_milestone()`; tokens transfer to the freelancer's Stellar address in the same transaction. Settlement in ~5 seconds.
